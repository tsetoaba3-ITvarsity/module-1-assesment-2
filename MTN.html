    <p>The company was founded in 1994 as M-Cell with assistance from the South African government.[6] In 1995, it replaced its then-CEO, John Beck, with Robert (Bob) Chaphe.[7] In 2001, the company reported that its controlling shareholder was Johnnic Holdings, and the chairperson was Irene Charnley.[8] In 2002, Phuthuma Nhleko became the CEO,[9] replacing then-CEO Paul Edwards, who had invested in expansion to Nigeria.[10]

MTN's competitors in South Africa include Vodacom, Cell C and Telkom Mobile.

In May 2008, Bharti Airtel, an India-based telecommunications company, explored the possibility of buying MTN Group.[11] Reliance Communications was also in talks with MTN for a "potential combination of their businesses".[12][13] In July, the two companies ended discussions regarding the merger.[14]

In June 2008, MTN Group agreed to purchase Verizon Business South Africa, which was a provider of data services to customers in South Africa and four other African countries.[15] The acquisition was completed on 28 February 2009.[16]

On 26 June 2009, MTN Group's subsidiary merged with Belgacom International Carrier Services (BICS), a subsidiary of Belgacom.[17] The combined subsidiary functioned as the international gateway for carrier services of MTN.[18]

In October 2012, MTN announced a partnership with Afrihost to provide DSL Broadband services in Africa.[19][20]
